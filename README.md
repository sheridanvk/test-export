# How to build your own Profile Site

This app is a finished version of a profile site that you can remix and build yourself. It's all HTML and CSS with a teeny bit of Javascript, so very beginner-friendly. We'll use Firefox to build this, because they have great debugging tools for frontend web programming.

## Step-by-step

### Lay out the HTML structure of your page

- Add HTML tags. We're going to use:
  section
  div
  img
  h1
  p
  details/summary

For the header we'll also need <link> and <script>

- Add CSS rule to colour and give width to the sections so you can see them

- Reset CSS

### Add a profile picture in whatever shape you want

First grab your photo and upload it to the assets directory

Use Clippy https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/ to generate the outline you'd like to use

Here's a photo you can use as a placeholder if you don't want to be rushed into making a decision!

### Add some social media links

Free icons from IconFinder (attribute in readme!)
I like this one https://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=iconset%3Alogos-and-brands-2

### Add web fonts to make the design your own
https://fonts.google.com/

### Add a collapsible section with more information about you

Details/summary
Social cards

### Make it look as good on desktop as on mobile

### Check out how it looks on non-Firefox browsers
