# CSS Art: Marlow Moss

I wanted to play around a bit with some projects to get better at CSS Grid, and per [Jen Simmons'](http://jensimmons.com/post/feb-27-2017/learn-css-grid) recommendation, I decided to see if it would be possible to reproduce art with it. My first thought was Mondrian, but turned out Jen herself had [already done that](https://labs.jensimmons.com/2017/01-011.html) :)

But then the fantastic Women's Art Twitter channel featured [Marlow Moss' work](https://mobile.twitter.com/womensart1/status/1020202134871203840) - turns out she was a contemporary of Mondrian, and they inspired each other (for example, the [double gridlines he sometimes used](https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/717/composition-double-line-and-yellow-1932) first showed up in her work).

Her art was a perfect candidate for CSS Grid - and in some ways even better, because it involves overlapping elements, which are a great candidate for this technology.

For the 3D art, I used the clip-path CSS polygons, instead of multiple smaller elements - this ensured that the drop shadows could still work out. [Bennett Feely's clip-path "Frame" tutorial](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) was a huge help to achieve this.
